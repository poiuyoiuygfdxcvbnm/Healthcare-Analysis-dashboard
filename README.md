🏥 Project Overview
💼 Business Problem
Healthcare organizations face challenges in managing large volumes of patient and operational data. Disparate data sources, lack of centralized visibility, and limited analytical tools make it difficult to:
1. Monitor patient demographics and outcomes
2. Track disease trends and treatment effectiveness
3. Evaluate hospital/clinic performance
4. Optimize cost and resource utilization
Decision-makers need an accessible, interactive tool to convert raw data into actionable insights that drive better patient care and efficient operations.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard aims to:
1. Provide a centralized view of key healthcare metrics
2. Enable stakeholders to explore patient data, treatment outcomes, and cost trends interactively
3. Support operational and clinical decision-making with visual analytics
4. Identify areas for improvement in patient care and resource usage
